# Shellcode Injection

2 basic apps that are able to inject shellcode.
The first one self-injects a payload to execute calc.exe
The second one allows to target a running PID to inject the calc.exe payload. Usage: `shellcode_inject.exe <Target PID>`

TODO:

<Provide screens of Memory allocated regions after executing the shellcode>
