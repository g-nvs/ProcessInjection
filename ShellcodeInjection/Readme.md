# Shellcode Injection

2 basic apps that are able to inject shellcode.</br>
The first one self-injects a payload to execute calc.exe</br>
The second one allows to target a running PID to inject the calc.exe payload.</br>
Usage: `shellcode_inject.exe <Target PID>`

TODO:
> Provide screens of Memory allocated regions after executing the shellcode
